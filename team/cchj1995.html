<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of a Software Engineering module, my team and I were given an objective to enhance or morph an existing application known as AddressBoook4(AB4). We opted to transform the application and the product of our efforts was TeethHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TeethHub was designed for dentists who are proficient with computers and comfortable with using a Command Line Interface(CLI) for interaction over a Graphical User Interface(GUI). Dentists can store, modify, interact and even export their patients, records and tasks, all the while enjoying clear graphical feedback. TeethHub was written in Java, building its graphical elements on JavaFX. As of v1.4, the application has roughly 20000 lines of codes, a difference of 10000 lines compared to AB4.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next three sections, I will be detailing a summary of my contributions,
excerpts from my documentation work for TeethHub&#8217;s User Guide and Developer&#8217;s Guide.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major implementation</strong>: added <strong>the task class and all its attributes</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The entire task data structure enables TeethHub to store information pertaining to our users' tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: As dentists, aside from having patients and records, our users will have tasks that they are required to complete. By enabling TeethHub to handle the information for these tasks, users can enjoy the benefits of having all of their important information being in the one application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This implementation serves as a stepping stone for future developments to provide more interaction with task information. Comprehensive understanding of the existing application (AB4) was necessary for this implementation as it essentially creates a new type of data for the application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to link a task to a patient</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This enhancement enables users to provide a link between a task and a patient by being specified as one of the task&#8217;s attributes either upon creation of a task or by modifiying a task&#8217;s information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This enhancement allows users to experience a cohesion between the information they have on TeethHub. In the real world, a dentist&#8217;s task often relates to a patient and by enabling TeethHub to emulate the same experience, the application can provide greater value to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This enhancement proved to be rather demanding as it involved augmenting and changing existing commands that modified or removed a patient. The challenge was in ensuring the linked task did not directly affect the linked patient when modified or deleted, while changing a linked patient had to change the task linked to it automatically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: added <strong>the ability to display a task calendar</strong></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: This enhancement allows the user to use a <code>taskcal</code> command to display a new popup window containing a calendar, a list of tasks and a commandbox. The displayed window provides users interactive information about their tasks, highlighting dates where tasks are present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This enhancement provides additional value and meaning to the task information TeethHub stores for its users. By giving users context for the tasks in the form of a calendar, users can more accurately view and plan their schedules as they have a clearer view of when they have tasks and how important are these tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: This was the most challenging enhancement I had made to the application because it involved in-depth understanding of the program&#8217;s GUI, considering the best means of displaying the calendar and the logical approach to finding the right dates to highlight.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added taskadd, taskedit and taskdelete commands to provide users to have the most basic but essential interactions with the task information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a taskdone command to enable users to automatically set a task to complete and add a record to its linked patient (if any).</p>

<p>Our user can also utilize TeethHub to store manage and interact with tasks aside from patients. Dentists would often have tasks that needs to be completed or performed and the implementation of the <code>Task</code> data object allows TeethHub to provide its user with the ability to manage these tasks and have them interact with their patient&#8217;s details when necessary as well. The main commands added with the data object serve to provide the user with a way to manage and view the tasks stored in the application.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current implementation:</strong> Tasks are stored in the same json file as patients.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Store the tasks in a seperate json file</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative Pros: Very unlikely to have a very large json file by saving different data types to a different file.The single json file that stores the data will not become too large if there are too many patients and/or tasks. Reduces the likelihood that the size of the json file will exceed the limit of certain file systems like FAT-32 with a limit of 4GB, which would result in the application being unable to save to the file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative Cons: Increases time spent opening a seperate json file. This results in more I/O work for application, decreasing application load time.Complicated to implement and affects future storage and I/O features. Implementation would affect I/O features that may need to read from the files to export both patients and tasks. Sets a precedent where new data types added in the future should be stored seperately for consistency, which would affect <code>export</code> and <code>import</code> commands as they have to be changed to read a new file to export/import.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice Justification</strong>: Most operating systems these days utilize a filesystem that allows for filesizes far beyond 4GB. The limit can go up to 2^64 bytes in NTFS for example and in almost all cases, it is unlikely for the a dentist to have such a large number of patients and tasks. Compared to the cons of the alternative where performance and increased likelihood of issues in the futre, the pros that the alternative offers do not seem valid enough to justify using it over the current choice.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current implementation:</strong> Java&#8217;s special Enumeration (Enum) class is used for the Priority class</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Use a normal class type, with string as inner attribute for Priority.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative Pros: Priorities can be named anything the user desires such as "code red", "code blue" for example. Easy to implement as it functions similarly to how <code>name</code> and <code>title</code> works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative Cons: Priority tracking depends on the user&#8217;s own memory of what he/she named them and sees as a higher priority, making it difficult for the program to display the appropriate color for priorities to benefit users. Goes against good programming practice which is to use enum for values that should not be changed and Enum is typically used to store priority types.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice Justification</strong>: Priorities being represented as "high", "med" and "low" is a common case and as such, most if not all people should be able to understand the naming convention. While giving freedom to the user is typically beneficial, in this case, it prevents the application from providing better more value to the user. The current choice uses terms that are understandable whilst providing benefits to the user by enabling a consistent colored display of priority tags.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current implementation:</strong> Target task and patient are replaced with new instances with priority changed and record added respectively.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Modify the target task and linked patient directly.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative Pros: Easy to implement as they already have methods to perform the operations Requires less operations to execute the command, leading to performance increase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative Cons: Completing a task does not work with undo and redo due to the way the model is implemented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice Justification</strong>: The current choice enables undo and redo to work with the task autocomplete feature, enabling tasks to be un-completed by using the undo command. This is important as the user could potentially key the wrong index when completing a task and wish to undo the command without having to manually edit the task. From tests done with the alternative, the performance increase is also  negligible at best. The lack of a strong benefit does not make up for the inability to undo/redo making the alternative less desirable as compared to the current choice.</p>

<h4 id="aspect-data-strcuture-to-support-task-calendar-generation"><a class="link" href="#aspect-data-strcuture-to-support-task-calendar-generation">Aspect: Data strcuture to support Task Calendar generation</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current implementation:</strong> HashMap is used to store dates that have task&#8217;s starting and/or ending.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong>  Use an ArrayList to store the dates instead.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative Pros: Does not require its stored values to have an <code>equals()</code> method. Lower memory consuption as there is no need to store both a key and a value. Retrieves elements with <code>get()</code> in O(1) time with a specified index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative Cons: Checking if an element exists within is O(n) time as the entire arraylist needs to be checked. Requires knowing the actual index in order to utilize the benefit of an O(1) retrieval.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice Justification</strong>: The generation of the calendar page requires a data structure that can check if a particular date is contained within itself in order to decide whether a date cell should be highlighted or not. Arraylist would be slower in this case as it would have to peform an O(n) every time a task gets iterated compared to the O(1) a HashMap offers. There is also no need to implement an <code>equals()</code> method for the DateCustom object to be stored as it is already implemented to ensure that there are no duplicate tasks. In this case, the current choices is a much better fit as compared to arraylist to support the calendar feature.</p>

<h4 id="aspect-method-of-displaying-task-calendar"><a class="link" href="#aspect-method-of-displaying-task-calendar">Aspect: Method of displaying Task Calendar</a></h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Current implementation:</strong> Task Calendar window is displayed in a seperate popup.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Alternative:</strong> Display the calendar in another pane in the Main Window.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alternative Pros: Everything can be shown at one glance to the user. No need to shuffle between windows. No need for a command to make the calendar show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternative Cons: Other elements displayed in the Main Window have to be shrunk along with the calendar&#8217;s contents to make space for the task calendar to be viewed. Main Window would be displaying too many things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choice Justification</strong>: Shrinking all elements in the Main Window would adversely affect the visibility of other important features the application provdies such as the patient&#8217;s information, the list of patients and list of tasks. This reduces the user experience as content cannot be clearly seen. Following the traditional usage of a calendar, most people typically look at a calendar when the need arises such as planning or scheduling. It would be better for a command to be provided and show the user a clear and distinct calendar only when he/she requires it, making the current choice ideal.</p>
