== About the Project: TeethHub

TeethHub is a desktop application specially designed for tech-savvy dentists, who prefers to use the command line interface, as opposed to the traditional graphical user interface.

The user interacts with the application through the type via the command line interface, and graphical representations of the stored data will be shown.
The program is written in Java.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: enhanced the *person* storage into a *dental patient* storage
** What it does: This new data structure allows our users to store personal information of patients.
** Justification: This data structure creates the foundation of the product, as TeethHub is an application which manages dental patients for our users.
** Highlights: This enhancements affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future.
The development of patient required an in-depth knowledge of the dentistry industry.
The implementation too was challenging as it required major changes to existing commands.

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to *store and manage dental records* to patients
** What it does: This allows our users to store dental records on TeethHub, which will be linked to a specified dental patient.
** Justification: This feature is essential to TeethHub as the product wish to offload the workload for dentists, and dental records are the primary documents which dentists handle.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects how data is stored, written and read.
It required a thorough understanding of the design requirements, as well as its constraints.
The implementation too was demanding, as many factors need to be considered.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a goto command that allows the user to navigate to the specified patient's record list from the current patient list.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a back command that allows the user to return back to the patient list from the current record list.

* *Minor enhancement*: added a new user interface which displays the dental record information of a specified patient.

=== General Commands

==== dentist

You can specify the name you want to reflect in your patients' dental record when you create them.

Format: `dentist n/YOUR_NAME`

* If there is no dentist name specified, the program will prompt you to enter one.

* This should only happen once, during the first startup of the application.

=== Implementations

=== Patient Management Feature
==== Current Implementation: Storing Patient's Information

The `Patient` class represents patients for our users on TeethHub.
It extends `Person` with more patient-specific attributes, as well as methods.
Various methods are also overridden in order for them to work appropriately with the new `Patient` class.

The following class diagram summarizes the new `Patient` class, which extends from `Person`:

image::PatientClassDiagram.png[align="center", width="400"]

==== Current Implementation: Patient's Dental Records

The `Record` class represents a dental record of a patient. Each `Patient` class has an list of `Record` as an attribute.

The `Record` class is purposely implemented to be similar to that of `Person`.
Just like person, record has associate classes for specific operations, such as storage.
This ensures that the processing of records is streamlined with `Patient`, which extends `Person`.

==== Current Implementation: Interface to interact with Patient's Dental Records

The current implementation to view a specified patient's dental records uses the `goto` command.

The `GoToCommand` extends the `Command` abstract class.
The valid form of the command is `goto INDEX`.
The `INDEX` of the command specifies the patient in the patient list, based to their denoted indexes.

On the other hand, the current implementation to go back to the patient list uses the `back` command.

It also extends the `Command` abstract class.
Unlike the `GoToCommand`, the `BackCommand` does not take in any parameters.
The valid form of the command is `back`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the goto/back mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
All stored patients will be loaded and the user will be shown the patient list by default.

Step 2. The user executes `goto 1` command to view the dental records of the first patient in the dental book.
The `goto` command sets the specified patient in the MainWindow as the first patient.
The patient list is now replaced by the dental record list of the specified patient.

Step 3. The user can now add, edit, or delete dental records, which are tied to the specified patient.

[NOTE]
If the `goto` command is entered while the window is already showing dental records of a specified patient, an error message will be displayed on the window.

Step 4. The user now decides that he wants to view the patient list.
He do so by executing the `back` command.
After which, the record list is replaced by the patient list.

[NOTE]
The `back` command will still work with parameters, but those parameters will be ignored.

Step 5. The user can now add, edit, or delete patients' personal information.

[NOTE]
If the `back` command is entered while the window is already showing patients, an error message will be displayed on the window.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `goto` or `back` command:

==== Current Implementation: Representing Patient's Teeth

The `Teeth` class represents patients' teeth for our users on TeethHub.
It consist of an array of `Tooth` objects, which represents the individual tooth of patients.

[NOTE]
When a patient is added by the user, TeethHub automatically creates a new set of all healthy and present teeth for the new patient.
At this point of time, only permanent teeth is supported.

Each `Tooth` can be present or absent. If it is present, it can be on or off status.
A tooth on status would mean that it is a problematic tooth (i.e. decaying tooth or dental prosthesis).
A optional status message can be tied to each tooth on status, allowing our users to have a better overview of the tooth if necessary.

The command to edit a specific tooth of a patient is: `teethedit INDEX`.

[NOTE]
The `teethedit` command can only run after a patient is specified via the `goto` command.


The following class diagram summarizes the `Teeth` class, which is a composition of the `Tooth` class:

==== Current Implementation: Automatically Generated Tags

There are only two types of tags that are valid in the `Patient` class.
They are `StatusTag` and `TeethTag`.
At any time, there can only be one of each kind of those tags.
Unlike in `Person`, users cannot added their own tags to patients.
We have implemented patient tags to be fully automated by our application.

`StatusTag`: Describes the condition of the patient's teeth. The valid options are "Healthy Teeth", "Status Teeth", and "Absent Teeth".
The worst tooth status found in the patient's teeth will be reflected in the teeth status tag.

The activity diagram below demonstrates how TeethHub automatically update the patient's status tag when his or her tooth is edited:

image::StatusTagActivityDiagram.png[align=center, width=""]

`TeethTag`: Describes the teeth type of the patient. The valid options are "Primary Teeth" or "Permanent Teeth".

[NOTE]
Since only permanent teeth is supported by TeethHub at the moment, `TeethTag` will always show "Permanent Teeth".

==== Current Implementation: Dentist Information

Following the single user policy, TeethHub only prompts the user once to acquire his or her name, which will then be used when creating new dental records for patients.

Currently, the application prompts the user for his or her name during his or her first attempt when adding a new dental record to a specified patient via the `RecordAdd` command.

[NOTE]
Currently, the dentist's name is stored in a `.txt` file in TeethHub.
It is possible for users to change their name from the `.txt` file, although they are not encouraged to do so.

==== Current Implementation: Other Relevant Commands

We have also created new commands that will facilitate the `Patient` class.

[NOTE]
The commands below can only be executed after a patient is specified via the `GoTo` command.

`RecordAdd`: Adds a new record to a specified patient.

`RecordEdit`: Edits an existing record of a specified patient.

`RecordDelete`: Deletes an existing record of a specified patient.

`RecordClear`: Clear all records of a specified patient.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Creating the Patient class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create the `Patient` class by extending it from `Person`.
** Pros: It is intuitive, as it is logical that all patients are persons as well.
The code from `Person` can be reused in `Patient` through inheritance, and all existing classes and methods which work with `Person` will also work with `Patient`.
Most importantly, it allows us to make use of the object-oriented programming principles we learnt in class.
We assume that the Open-Closed Principle is applied on the `Person` class.
** Cons: Any changes to `Person` may affect `Patient`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create the `Patient` class from the bottom-up.
** Pros: As `Patient` will not be a subclass of any other class, it will be less affected by changes in other classes.
** Cons: All existing classes and methods which currently work with `Person` needs to be re-written to work with the new `Patient` class.
Attributes and methods cannot be reused, and must be re-implemented.
Lastly, polymorphism cannot be applied in cases where there is a need to deal with both persons and patients.

===== Aspect: Picking the appropriate data structure to store dental records

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the records using a list.
** Pros: It is easy to understand, which is crucial for collaborative programming as other programmers may require accessing the records in the list.
It can also save new records in the order of when they are added, from most recent to oldest, simply using `List.add(0, Record)`.
** Cons: If the list gets long over time, it might cause additional waiting time for our users when they would to search for a specific record.
This is because a linear search in a list is of O(n) time complexity.
 * **Alternative 2:** Store the records using a hash table.
 ** Pros: It gives the fastest time complexity if a record search is required. It runs in O(1) time.
 ** Cons: It can be challenging for collaborators to understand, which can be detrimental for collaborative programming.
 It also creates an extra layer of complexity in order to display the stored records in the order they were first stored in the application by our users.

===== Aspect: How the goto command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a static variable to store the specified patient, with a public getter method, and a static boolean that denotes the current list viewing mode.
** Pros: This is relatively easy to implement and understand. Furthermore, other classes can easily access the current specified patient, and the current list viewing mode.
** Cons: May cause complications if MainWindow is no longer a singleton class.
* **Alternative 2:** Save the specified patient and list viewing mode as an instance variable of MainWindow.
** Pros: Will work properly even if MainWindow is no longer a singleton class.
** Cons: Challenging to implement as major revamp is required to most existing classes and tests.
All new classes which wish to access the specified patient or list viewing mode will need to take in a reference to the MainWindow instance.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the goto command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a patient variable to store the patient specified by the command.
** Pros: An intuitive solution, as the specified patient is stored as an exact same class as a patient.
Additionally, attributes of the specified patient can be accessed just like any other patient class.
Changes to the patient class does not significantly affect the goto command.
** Cons: The patient class is mutable, and accidental changes to its attributes by other classes or methods can occur.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new immutable patient variable to store the specified patient.
** Pros: Ensures the the specified patient cannot be edited by other classes or methods.
** Cons: Major changes to the patient class would require the immutable patient class to be changed too.
Furthermore, every time any record of the specified patient is modified, a new immutable patient needs to be created to update the currently stored immutable patient.

===== Aspect: Data structure for Teeth

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Tooth` object representing a tooth, and use an array to store a list of tooth which will represent the teeth of patients.
** Pros: An straightforward object-oriented solution and easy to understand by other collaborating programmers who are familiar with object-oriented programming.
** Cons: `Tooth` and `Teeth` objects, as well as their relevant methods takes a significant amount of time to be created. They will also require proper test cases to be implemented.
* **Alternative 2:** Create an integer array representing teeth. Each integer value in the array indicates the status of a tooth.
** Pros: Simplest to implement.
** Cons: Can be hard to understand by other programmers as integers are used to represent teeth statuses. Additionally, this is violating object-oriented principles.

===== Aspect: Implementing the Dentist class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a patient variable to store the patient specified by the command.
** Pros: An intuitive solution, as the specified patient is stored as an exact same class as a patient.
Additionally, attributes of the specified patient can be accessed just like any other patient class.
Changes to the patient class does not significantly affect the goto command.
** Cons: The patient class is mutable, and accidental changes to its attributes by other classes or methods can occur.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new immutable patient variable to store the specified patient.
** Pros: Ensures the the specified patient cannot be edited by other classes or methods.
** Cons: Major changes to the patient class would require the immutable patient class to be changed too.
Furthermore, every time any record of the specified patient is modified, a new immutable patient needs to be created to update the currently stored immutable patient.

=== Manual Tests

==== Patient and Record lists

. Switching of UI elements when `goto` command is run

.. Prerequisites: List all patients using the `list` command. At least one patient should be displayed in the list.
.. Test case: `goto 1` (Patient of index 1) +
   Expected: The patient list GUI is replaced by the record list GUI. Displays dental records of patient specified by index. The window size may not be optimum. Use the command: `back` to revert to the patient list.
.. Test case: `back` +
   Expected: No GUI elements changed. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

. Switching of UI elements when `back` command is run

.. Prerequisites: Run the `goto 1` command. GUI displays dental record list.
.. Test case: `back` +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample patients. An alert box prompts for confirmation. The window size may not be optimum. Use the command: `goto 1` to revert to the dental record list.
.. Test case: `goto` +
   Expected: No GUI elements changed. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

==== Deleting a dental record

. Deleting a record while all dental records of a patient are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all dental records of a patient using the `goto x` command (x refers to the index of the patient to be tested). Multiple dental records should be displayed in the list.
.. Test case: `recorddelete 1` +
   Expected: First dental record is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted dental record is shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.
.. Test case: `recorddelete 0` +
   Expected: No record is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect recorddelete commands to try: `recorddelete`, `record delete`, `recorddelete x` (where x is larger than the list size), `recorddelete y` (where y is a negative number), `recorddelete z` (where z is not an integer) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.
