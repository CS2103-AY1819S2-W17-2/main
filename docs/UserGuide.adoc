== Introduction

OurTeeth is for dental practitioners who want to manage patient records
through a desktop or mobile app. The application works primarily through
a Command Line Interface (CLI) while having elements of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) for greater visualization of data. The application
provides a platform for dentists to keep track of their patients’
personal particulars along with their dental records. Conditions of each
patients’ teeth (e.g decaying, removed or filled) are also stored for
ease of reference when providing treatments or follow-ups. As the
application uses CLI, users who prefer using command line interface will
be able to comfortably navigate through the many features the offered by
the application.

=== Teeth

==== Brief Description


The OurTeeth application complies with the most popular standard of the
three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in the dentistry field - The
Universal Numbering System.


==== The Universal Numbering System

image::images/image1.png[image,width=200,height=294]

The uppercase letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.


==== Creating and Editing Teeth Layout
There are two templates provided by the application: primary and
permanent.

All primary or permanent teeth in template will all be present and
healthy by default.


* To create a new teeth layout for patient:

** `teeth add n/NRIC <Template>`

** Note that if a teeth layout already exist, a warning will be thrown to
confirm the user’s overwriting intention

* To edit a new specific tooth:

** `teeth edit n/NRIC t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS -d/DESCRIPTION`

** Valid <Teeth Label> are letters A through T (case-insensitive, for
primary teeth), and numbers 1 - 32 (for permanent teeth)

** Note that if a teeth layout does not exist, a new layout will be created
based on the teeth label group used, before the edit is applied on the
newly created teeth layout.

** <Status> reflects overall health of the indicated tooth, and valid
<Status> are “healthy”, “absent”, “treatment” and “review”

** <Description> is an optional field to present dentists with a feature to
indicate personalised note describing more detail on the patient’s teeth
health.

=== Export
Exports the entire records into the specified file path with the
specified file name.

Format: `export FILE_PATH FILE_NAME`

Example:


* `export /mnt/ext_drive/ clinicRecords.txt` +
Creates a file named clinicRecords.txt in the /mnt/ext_drive/ folder


=== Import
Imports data into the program from the specified file path and
overwrites current data.

Format: `import FILE_PATH [append]`

Note: The optional “append” adds the file data onto the current records
rather than overwriting.

Examples:


* `import /mnt/sample/newData` +
Replaces the current records with the ones in the newData file


* `import /mnt/sample/extraData append` +
Appends the records within extraData onto the current program’s records.


=== List
Shows a list of all personnel or medical stored in the application

Format: `list [dental]`

Command shows personnel details by default, add dental to see dental
records.

Example:

* `list` +
Shows details of all patients


* `list dental` +
Shows details of patients’ dental records


=== Find
Shows persons whose data contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find [dental] KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* Add “dental” to search dental records instead
* Search is case insensitive
* Order of keywords does not matter

Example:


* `find Yishun` +
Show all the people that live in Yishun


* `find dental cleaning` +
Shows all the dental records with cleaning


=== Sort
Sorts the records by an input parameter in an input order.

Format: `sort PARAM ORDER`

Example:

[cols=",,,",options="header",]

application in reverse chronological order

=== Appointments [Coming in v2.0]
Schedule patient appointments.


=== Cloud [Coming in v2.0]
Synchronises the data stored with the cloud database


== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost, we
will allow users to synchronise their data with a cloud account. From
there, should the worst happen and the user’s local data be lost, it can
be downloaded from the cloud.


== Spell-Checker Functionality [Coming in v2.0]


Upon keying in an improperly typed command it will automatically correct
it (e.g. sirt to sort) and run the program.


== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data
file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous
Address Book folder. Alternatively, upload your data to the cloud and
download it from there.

*Q*: How can I be sure my patient’s records are secure?

*A*: The application’s login feature ensures only that particular user
will be able to access his or her own patients. Records of other users
will be encrypted and unviewable unless one logs in.
