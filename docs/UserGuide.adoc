== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub!
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!

TeethHub works primarily through a CLI while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select patients and records by clicking on them, but you would need to type the edit commands to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patient's particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patient's teeth will also be displayed according to what you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks, just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out <<prerequisites>> to see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to work properly.

[NOTE]
============================================================
You can also use `exit!` to forcefully exit the application
============================================================

=== File Management

TeethHub automatically saves all data in TeethHub.json when you close the program.
However, you can manage them manually with `open`, `save`, `import` and `export`. +
 +
*When we mention "data", we mean the patients list and their respective records plus the task list.* +
 +
You can use `open` to open another .json file that you may have transferred over from another computer. +
 +
You can use `save` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file. +
 +
You can use `import` to add specific patients from another .json file to your current data. +
 +
You can use `export` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file.

[NOTE]
============================================================
Look for your *saved* or *exported* files in the "data" folder. +
This is also where TeethHub looks for your files when you use `open` or `import`.
============================================================

[NOTE]
============================================================
The File Management Commands uses the following keywords!

`FILE_PATH`: +
Any letters in the English alphabet and numbers are allowed. +
Allowed special characters are: +
`! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] ; ' , .` +
Special characters *NOT* allowed are: +
`< > : " | ? *`

`INDEX_RANGE`: +
Any positive integers (numbers with no decimals, must be greater than 0) are allowed.
You can use commas (no space) to choose multiple individual indexes. e.g. `1,3,5` for 1 and 3 and 5 +
You can use dash (no space) to choose a range of indexes. e.g. `3-5` for 3 to 5. `1-3-5` is not allowed, just use `1-5`. +
You can use a combination of commas and dashes to choose a range as well. e.g. `1-3,5` for 1 to 3 and 5. +
You can also type `all` instead to import/export everything.
============================================================

Format: `recordclear` or `rclear`

[NOTE]
`recordclear` requires the application to first be in records mode, via the `goto` command.

=== Teeth Management
==== Teeth Create

There is no command required for this feature, as the application automatically generates and stores a new set of all healthy permanent teeth for newly added patients.

TeethHub complies with the most popular standard of the three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in Dentistry - The Universal Numbering System.

ifdef::env-github[]
image::BaseLayer.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The upper-case letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.

[NOTE]
At the moment, only the permanent teeth type is supported.

==== Teeth Edit

This command edits a specific tooth of a patient.

Format: `teethedit t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS`

* `TEETH_LABEL` are integers 1 to 32, which represents a tooth according to the Universal Numbering System.

* Valid `STATUS` are 0 (for healthy tooth), 1 (for problematic tooth), or 2 (for missing tooth).

Example:

* `<<goto, goto>> 1` - Specifies patient 1 to edit his or her teeth status. User enters the records mode.

* `teethedit t/31 s/2` - This edits the status of tooth 31 of the specified patient to missing.

* `<<back, back>>` - This command allows the user to exit the record edit mode, returning to the patients mode.

// end::patient_management_kyler[]

=== Task Management
==== taskadd
Adds a task to the application's list of tasks.

Format: `taskadd PARAMETERS` or `tadd PARAMETERS`

You can specify information that describes the task you wish to add by
keying in certain tags after the `taskadd` command. Do note the following:

* All parameters have certain patterns that **MUST** be followed. +

* Some parameters are mandatory when adding a task. +

* Non-mandatory tasks will be assigned a default value if not specified.


Table 1 shows the list of parameters along with their respective descriptions.
Mandatory parameters are marked with an asterisk `*` in the attribute section of the table.



.Task parameters
|===
|Attribute |Description |Tag |Example

|Title*
|General description for the task to be added.

You can provide any alphanumeric characters and the special characters:
`( ,@, !, ?, ., -` when giving the title for the task. Other characters not specified will not be allowed
due to security reasons.
|ti/TEXT
|ti/Tooth Extraction

|Start date*
|The date in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the start date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and should not be a date that is BEFORE the current date.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Only *possible* dates are accepted as valid as the program follows the calendar strictly.
For example, `31-04-2019` will be flagged as invalid as there are only 30 days in April.

As of the current version, 29th of February in a leap year (29-02-2019) is not accepted as a valid input, but will be
implemented in future versions.

|sd/DD-MM-YYYY
|sd/19-12-2019

|End date
|The date in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the end date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, following standard date values. The end date should not be
BEFORE the task's START DATE.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Other validity checks for the end date are the same as that of start date.

Default value if not specified: Task's start date.
|ed/DD-MM-YYYY
|ed/19-12-2019

|Start time*
|The specific time in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.

Only *real* time values are accepted as valid inputs. For example, values such as `1265` or `2500` are not valid as
these are not time values used in the current world.
|st/HHMM
|st/0845

|End time*
|The specific time in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.
If the task's start date and end date are the same, the end time should also not be BEFORE the start time.

Other validity checks for the end time are the same as that of the start time.
|et/HHMM
|et/1245

|Priority
|The priority level of the task to be performed.

You should provide the priority as `high`, `med`, `low` or `completed` in either upper or lowercase.
Tasks with different priority will be marked with different colored labels on the task list.
High priority will be marked [red]#red#, Medium priority be marked [orange]#orange# and
Low priority will be marked [yellow]#yellow#. Completed tasks will be marked with [green]#green#.

Default value if not specified: [yellow]#Low#
|pri/PRIORITY
|pri/high

|Patient
|The patient to be linked to the task. Linking a patient to a task, enables the <<taskdone, taskdone>> command to
 automatically add a record upon execution.

The patient's index must be a valid POSITIVE integer and it can be found in the patient list next to the name.
If you want to set a task's linked patient to none, you can give this parameter
a value of `0` when using the <<taskedit, taskedit>> command. This parameter should not be included in task adding or
task editing when in <<goto, goto>> mode as the patient list is not visible in that mode. +

If a linked patient is <<edit, edited>> pr <<delete, deleted>>, the affected tasks will be updated accordingly.

Default value if not specified: 0 (indicates that no patient is linked to the task)
|pat/INDEX
|pat/2

|===

[NOTE]
============================================================
Duplicate task will not be added into the program.

Tasks are considered duplicates if they have the *exact*
same TITLE, START DATE, START TIME, END TIME and
LINKED PATIENT

Format: `taskdelete 2` or `tdelete 2`

* Index of a task shown in the list **MUST** be specified +
* Index should be a positive integer (e.g. 1,2...5)
* Index of the tasks will be shown next to task's title in the task list

  `taskdelete 2`

==== tasklist
Shows a list of all the task stored in the application.

Format: `tasklist` or `tlist`

Format : 'tasksort priority/startime/endtime [asc/desc]'

Example:

*`tasksort priority`

*`tasksort starttime desc`

==== taskdone
Sets a task to `[green]#complete#`, marking the completion of the task.
Executing this command on a patient that has a patient linked to it will automatically add a record to the patient.

Format: `taskdone INDEX`

==== taskcal
Creates a popup window with a list of tasks on the left hand side of the window and a calendar on the right hand side.
There will also be a command box below the calendar, allowing you to execute task commands from this window as well.

format: `taskcal` or `taskcal DD-MM-YYYY`

You will see day cells in the calendar highlighted in color of the highest priority task for that day.
The top pane of the calendar has clickable buttons that lets you display the dates for different months and years.

You can also click on a numbered date cell which will select it and the task display panel will be updated to show tasks that have either their
`start date` or `end date` on that date. You can also key in a specific date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` into the
command box `e.g. 30-03-2019` and that day will be selected.

Executing the command without specifying a date will cause the current date to be selected by default.

=== Suggestion Commands
Sometimes, you may forget the exact way to type some commands or you may get confused. +
After all, Patient Management has `patientadd`, Records Management has `recordadd` and Task Management has `taskadd`! +
Even worse, some commands cannot be used in certain modes. +
If this ever happens, you can either open the <<help, help>> window again, or simply type out their common word due to our suggestion commands!

The Suggestion commands are: `add`, `clear`, `copy`, `delete`, `edit`, `find`, `list`, `select` and `sort`.

Suppose if you want to add something but you have forgotten the exact command. +
Simply enter `add`, and TeethHub will ask you if you meant `patientadd` or `recordadd` or `taskadd`. +
Don't worry about the commands that cannot be used in your current mode; the Suggestion commands will only suggest commands that can be used in your current mode.

For example, if you were to type `add` in Patient Mode, you will see `patientadd` and `taskadd`:

image::SuggestionFeatureAddPatientMode.png[width="236"]

If you were to type `add` in Record Mode, you will see `recordadd` and `taskadd` instead:

image::SuggestionFeatureAddRecordMode.png[width="236"]

== Patient Teeth per record [Coming in v1.5]

Currently, TeethHub stores and displays the latest teeth image of each patient.
We understand that you may want to see teeth changes over time.
In v1.5, TeethHub will be able to store and display a teeth image for each record.

== Adding images to records [Coming in v1.6]

Currently, TeethHub is not equipped to accept images from you.
We understand that you may want to store x-rays of teeth or other relevant images you have taken.
In v1.6, TeethHub will have a new command for you to upload images.

== Spell-Checker Functionality [Coming in v1.7]

// tag::2.0_kyler[]
== Support for Primary Teeth Type [Coming in v2.0]

To allow the application to truly be able to cater for all dental patients of our user.

== Implementation of Other Teeth Numbering Standards [Coming in v2.0]

TeethHub can adopt other common teeth numbering standards such as the ISO System or Palmer notation method.
This allows our users to pick the numbering standard they are most familiar with.

// end::2.0_kyler[]

== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost,
you will be able to synchronise your data with a cloud account.

Currently, TeethHub does not have a spell checker.
It would be great if TeethHub would automatically correct an improperly typed command(e.g. sirt to sort).
In v1.7, TeethHub will have a spell checker functionality.

== Placeholder [Coming in v1.8]

== Placeholder [Coming in v1.9]

== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]

Currently, TeethHub is not connected to a cloud.
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost,
you should be able to synchronise your data with a cloud account.
In v2.0, TeethHub will be synchronized with a cloud server.

== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

*A*: Install TeethHub in the other computer and overwrite the empty data
file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous
Address Book folder. Alternatively, upload your data to the cloud and
download it from there.
