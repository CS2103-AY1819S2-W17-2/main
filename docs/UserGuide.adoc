== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub! 
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!
The application works primarily through a CLI
while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select and view patients and records by clicking on them,
but you would need to type type the edit command to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patients’
personal particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patients’ teeth will also be displayed according to what
you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks,
just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out section 2 <<_prerequisites>> to
see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to
work properly. Once that’s settled, or you’re confident in your computer
set-up, jump to section 3 [Quick Start Guide] to begin!

==  Prerequisites

Before downloading and installing TeethHub, please check that you have
the following programs installed:

* Java Runtime Environment version *9* or later.

=== Teeth

==== Brief Description


The TeethHub application complies with the most popular standard of the
three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in the dentistry field - The
Universal Numbering System.


==== The Universal Numbering System

ifdef::env-github[]
image::image1.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

ifndef::env-github[]
image::image1.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The uppercase letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.


==== Creating and Editing Teeth Layout
There are two templates provided by the application: primary and
permanent.

All primary or permanent teeth in template will all be present and
healthy by default.


* To create a new teeth layout for patient:

** `teeth add n/NRIC <Template>`

** Note that if a teeth layout already exist, a warning will be thrown to
confirm the user’s overwriting intention

* To edit a new specific tooth:

** `teeth edit n/NRIC t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS -d/DESCRIPTION`

** Valid <Teeth Label> are letters A through T (case-insensitive, for
primary teeth), and numbers 1 - 32 (for permanent teeth)

** Note that if a teeth layout does not exist, a new layout will be created
based on the teeth label group used, before the edit is applied on the
newly created teeth layout.

** <Status> reflects overall health of the indicated tooth, and valid
<Status> are “healthy”, “absent”, “treatment” and “review”

** <Description> is an optional field to present dentists with a feature to
indicate personalised note describing more detail on the patient’s teeth
health.

=== Open
Opens the file in the specified file path and overwrites the current records.
** Note that 'open' always searches inside the data folder.
** You can only open .json files.

Format: `open FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `open records1.json` +
Replaces the current records with the records in "records1.json".

* `open february\records2.json` +
Replaces the current records with the records in "records2.json" found in the "february" folder.


=== Save
Saves the current records to the specified filepath.
** Note that 'save' always saves inside the data folder. If no such filepath exists,
it will be created. Otherwise, it will overwrite the existing file.
** You can only save to .json and .pdf.
.json files allow you to open or import them.
.pdf files are easier for humans to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `save FILE_PATH`

Examples:

* `save records1.json` +
Saves the current records to "records1.json".

* `save february\records2.pdf` +
Saves the current records to "records1.json" found in the "february" folder.


=== Import
Opens the file in the specified file path and adds the specified patients to the current records.
** Note that 'import' always searches inside the data folder.
** You can only import .json files.

Format: `import FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

Examples:

* `import records1.json 1` +
Adds patient 1 from "records1.json" to the current records.

* `import february\records1.json 1` +
Adds patient 1 from "records1.json" found in the "february" folder to the current records.

* `import records1.json 1,4` +
Adds patient 1 and patient 4 from "records1.json" to the current records.

* `import records1.json 1-4` +
Adds patient 1 to patient 4 from "records1.json" to the current records.

* `import records1.json 1,3-5` +
Adds patient 1 and patient 3 to patient 5 from "records1.json" to the current records..


=== Export
Saves the specified patients in the current records to the specified filepath.
** Note that 'export' always saves inside the data folder. If no such filepath exists,
it will be created. Otherwise, it will overwrite the existing file.
** You can only export to .json and .pdf.
.json files allow you to open or import them.
.pdf files are easier for humans to read, but you cannot open or import them with TeethHub.

Format: `export FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

Examples:

* `export records1.json 1` +
Saves patient 1 from the current records to "records1.json".

* `export february\records1.pdf 1` +

== Cloud Functionality [Coming in v2.0]
To increase data redundancy and reduce the risk of data being lost, we
will allow users to synchronise their data with a cloud account. From
there, should the worst happen and the user’s local data be lost, it can
be downloaded from the cloud.


== Spell-Checker Functionality [Coming in v2.0]


Upon keying in an improperly typed command it will automatically correct
it (e.g. sirt to sort) and run the program.


== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data
file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous
Address Book folder. Alternatively, upload your data to the cloud and
download it from there.

*Q*: How can I be sure my patient’s records are secure?

*A*: The application’s login feature ensures only that particular user
will be able to access his or her own patients. Records of other users
will be encrypted and unviewable unless one logs in.
