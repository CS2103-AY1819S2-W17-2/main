== Introduction

Welcome to TeethHub!
If you are a dental practitioner who prefers to use a Command Line Interface (CLI),
then TeethHub is an application for you!

TeethHub works primarily through a CLI while having elements of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
For example, you can select patients and records by clicking on them, but you would need to type the edit commands to edit them.
TeethHub allows you to keep track of your patient's particulars along with their dental records.
An image of each patient's teeth will also be displayed according to what you input for each tooth's status(Absent, Problem, Healthy).
In addition to that, TeethHub also allows you to keep track of your upcoming tasks, just like a calendar.

Interested in trying TeethHub out? Check out <<prerequisites>> to see what programs you need in order for TeethHub to work properly.
If you’re confident in your computer set-up, jump to <<quick-start-guide>> to begin!

=== File Management

TeethHub automatically saves all data in TeethHub.json when you close the program.
However, you can manage them manually with `open`, `save`, `import` and `export`. +
 +
*When we mention "data", we mean the patients list and their respective records plus the task list.* +
*.json files hold data that TeethHub can read. Use this to "save" or "load" your progress.* +
*.pdf files hold data that are easier for people to read. Use this if you are printing out a physical copy.* +
 +
You can use `open` to open another .json file that you may have transferred over from another computer. +
 +
You can use `save` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file. +
 +
You can use `import` to add specific patients from another .json file to your current data. +
 +
You can use `export` to save specific patients to a .json or .pdf file.

==== open
Opens the file in the specified file path and overwrites the current data. +
** Note that 'open' always searches inside the data folder.** +
** You can only open .json files.**

=== Teeth Management

==== Brief Description

TeethHub complies with the most popular standard of the three the Dental Numbering Systems utilised in Dentistry - The Universal Numbering System.

==== The Universal Numbering System

ifdef::env-github[]
image::BaseLayer.png[width="200"]
endif::[]

The upper-case letters A through T are used for primary teeth and the
numbers 1 - 32 are used for permanent teeth. The tooth designated "1" is
the maxillary right third molar ("wisdom tooth") and the count continues
along the upper teeth to the left side. Then the count begins at the
mandibular left third molar, designated number 17, and continues along
the bottom teeth to the right side. Each tooth has a unique number or
letter, allowing for easier use on keyboards.

==== Creating and Editing Teeth Layout

There is one template provided by TeethHub: permanent teeth.

All permanent teeth in template will all be present and healthy by default.

* To create a new teeth layout for patient:

** The program automatically creates a new permanent teeth template for new patients added.

* To edit a new specific tooth:

** `<<goto, goto>> 1` - Specifies patient 1 to edit his or her teeth status. Enters the record edit mode.

** `teethedit t/TEETH_LABEL s/STATUS` - Edits the status of the indicated tooth of patient.

** `back` - Exits the record edit mode, and returns to the patient list.

** Valid <Teeth Label> are numbers 1 - 32 (permanent teeth).

** <Status> reflects overall health of the indicated tooth, and valid
<Status> are "healthy", "problem" and "absent".

** <Description> is an optional field that allows you to
write a note describing more detail on the patient’s teeth
health.

=== Task Management
==== taskadd
Adds a task to the application's list of tasks.

Format: `taskadd PARAMETERS` or `tadd PARAMETERS`

You can specify information that describes the task you wish to add by
keying in certain tags after the `taskadd` command. Do note the following:

* All parameters have certain patterns that **MUST** be followed. +

* Some parameters are mandatory when adding a task. +

* Non-mandatory tasks will be assigned a default value if not specified.


Table 1 shows the list of parameters along with their respective descriptions.
Mandatory parameters are marked with an asterisk `*` in the attribute section of the table.



.Task parameters
|===
|Attribute |Description |Tag |Example

|Title*
|General description for the task to be added.

You can provide any alphanumeric characters and the special characters:
`( ,@, !, ?, ., -` when giving the title for the task. Other characters not specified will not be allowed
due to security reasons.
|ti/TEXT
|ti/Tooth Extraction

|Start date*
|The date in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the start date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` and should not be a date that is BEFORE the current date.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Only *possible* dates are accepted as valid as the program follows the calendar strictly.
For example, `31-04-2019` will be flagged as invalid as there are only 30 days in April.

As of the current version, 29th of February in a leap year (29-02-2019) is not accepted as a valid input, but will be
implemented in future versions.

|sd/DD-MM-YYYY
|sd/19-12-2019

|End date
|The date in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the end date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`, following standard date values. The end date should not be
BEFORE the task's START DATE.
You can also use the keyword `today` as an input which will use the current date as the start date.

Other validity checks for the end date are the same as that of start date.

Default value if not specified: Task's start date.
|ed/DD-MM-YYYY
|ed/19-12-2019

|Start time*
|The specific time in which the task is set to begin.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.

Only *real* time values are accepted as valid inputs. For example, values such as `1265` or `2500` are not valid as
these are not time values used in the current world.
|st/HHMM
|st/0845

|End time*
|The specific time in which the task is set to end.

You should provide the time in the format `HHMM` (hours and minutes) and should also follow standard time values.
If the task's start date and end date are the same, the end time should also not be BEFORE the start time.

Other validity checks for the end time are the same as that of the start time.
|et/HHMM
|et/1245

|Priority
|The priority level of the task to be performed.

You should provide the priority as `high`, `med`, `low` or `completed` in either upper or lowercase.
Tasks with different priority will be marked with different colored labels on the task list.
High priority will be marked [red]#red#, Medium priority be marked [orange]#orange# and
Low priority will be marked [yellow]#yellow#. Completed tasks will be marked with [green]#green#.

Default value if not specified: [yellow]#Low#
|pri/PRIORITY
|pri/high

|Patient
|The patient to be linked to the task. Linking a patient to a task, enables the <<taskdone, taskdone>> command to
 automatically add a record upon execution.

The patient's index must be a valid POSITIVE integer and it can be found in the patient list next to the name.
If you want to set a task's linked patient to none, you can give this parameter
a value of `0` when using the <<taskedit, taskedit>> command. This parameter should not be included in task adding or
task editing when in <<goto, goto>> mode as the patient list is not visible in that mode. +

If a linked patient is <<edit, edited>> pr <<delete, deleted>>, the affected tasks will be updated accordingly.

Default value if not specified: 0 (indicates that no patient is linked to the task)
|pat/INDEX
|pat/2
