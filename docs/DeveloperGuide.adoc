By: `Team W17-2`      Since: `14 Mar 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repository, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repository.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::patient_kyler[]
=== Patient Management Feature
==== Current Implementation: Storing Patient's Information

The `Patient` class represents patients for our users on TeethHub.
It extends `Person` with more patient-specific attributes, as well as methods.
Various methods are also overridden in order for them to work appropriately with the new `Patient` class.

The following class diagram summarizes the new `Patient` class, which extends from `Person`:

image::PatientClassDiagram.png[width="800]

==== Current Implementation: Patient's Dental Records

The `Record` class represents a dental record of a patient. Each `Patient` class has an list of `Record` as an attribute.

The `Record` class is purposely implemented to be similar to that of `Person`.
Just like person, record has associate classes for specific operations, such as storage.
This ensures that the processing of records is streamlined with `Patient`, which extends `Person`.

==== Current Implementation: Interface to interact with Patient's Dental Records

The current implementation to view a specified patient's dental records uses the `goto` command.

The `GoToCommand` extends the `Command` abstract class.
The valid form of the command is `goto INDEX`.
The `INDEX` of the command specifies the patient in the patient list, based to their denoted indexes.

On the other hand, the current implementation to go back to the patient list uses the `back` command.

It also extends the `Command` abstract class.
Unlike the `GoToCommand`, the `BackCommand` does not take in any parameters.
The valid form of the command is `back`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the goto/back mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
All stored patients will be loaded and the user will be shown the patient list by default.

Step 2. The user executes `goto 1` command to view the dental records of the first patient in the dental book.
The `goto` command sets the specified patient in the MainWindow as the first patient.
The patient list is now replaced by the dental record list of the specified patient.

Step 3. The user can now add, edit, or delete dental records, which are tied to the specified patient.

[NOTE]
If the `goto` command is entered while the window is already showing dental records of a specified patient, an error message will be displayed on the window.

Step 4. The user now decides that he wants to view the patient list.
He do so by executing the `back` command.
After which, the record list is replaced by the patient list.

[NOTE]
The `back` command will still work with parameters, but those parameters will be ignored.

Step 5. The user can now add, edit, or delete patients' personal information.

[NOTE]
If the `back` command is entered while the window is already showing patients, an error message will be displayed on the window.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `goto` or `back` command:

image::GotoActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]
{nbsp}

==== Current Implementation: Representing Patient's Teeth

The `Teeth` class represents patients' teeth for our users on TeethHub.
It consist of an array of `Tooth` objects, which represents the individual tooth of patients.

[NOTE]
When a patient is added by the user, TeethHub automatically creates a new set of all healthy and present teeth for the new patient.
At this point of time, only permanent teeth is supported.

Each `Tooth` can be present or absent. If it is present, it can be on or off status.
A tooth on status would mean that it is a problematic tooth (i.e. decaying tooth or dental prosthesis).
A optional status message can be tied to each tooth on status, allowing our users to have a better overview of the tooth if necessary.

The command to edit a specific tooth of a patient is: `teethedit INDEX`.

[NOTE]
The `teethedit` command can only run after a patient is specified via the `goto` command.


The following class diagram summarizes the `Teeth` class, which is a composition of the `Tooth` class:

{nbsp}

image::TeethClassDiagram.png[width=""]
{nbsp}

==== Current Implementation: Automatically Generated Tags

There are only two types of tags that are valid in the `Patient` class.
They are `StatusTag` and `TeethTag`.
At any time, there can only be one of each kind of those tags.
Unlike in `Person`, users cannot added their own tags to patients.
We have implemented patient tags to be fully automated by our application.

`StatusTag`: Describes the condition of the patient's teeth. The valid options are "Healthy Teeth", "Status Teeth", and "Absent Teeth".
The worst tooth status found in the patient's teeth will be reflected in the teeth status tag.

The activity diagram below demonstrates how TeethHub automatically update the patient's status tag when his or her tooth is edited:

image::StatusTagActivityDiagram.png[width=""]

`TeethTag`: Describes the teeth type of the patient. The valid options are "Primary Teeth" or "Permanent Teeth".

[NOTE]
Since only permanent teeth is supported by TeethHub at the moment, `TeethTag` will always show "Permanent Teeth".

==== Current Implementation: Dentist Information

Following the single user policy, TeethHub only prompts the user once to acquire his or her name, which will then be used when creating new dental records for patients.

Currently, the application prompts the user for his or her name during his or her first attempt when adding a new dental record to a specified patient via the `RecordAdd` command.

[NOTE]
Currently, the dentist's name is stored in a `.txt` file in TeethHub.
It is possible for users to change their name from the `.txt` file, although they are not encouraged to do so.

==== Current Implementation: Other Relevant Commands

We have also created new commands that will facilitate the `Patient` class.

[NOTE]
The commands below can only be executed after a patient is specified via the `GoTo` command.

`RecordAdd`: Adds a new record to a specified patient.

`RecordEdit`: Edits an existing record of a specified patient.

`RecordDelete`: Deletes an existing record of a specified patient.

`RecordClear`: Clear all records of a specified patient.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Creating the Patient class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create the `Patient` class by extending it from `Person`.
** Pros: It is intuitive, as it is logical that all patients are persons as well.
The code from `Person` can be reused in `Patient` through inheritance, and all existing classes and methods which work with `Person` will also work with `Patient`.
Most importantly, it allows us to make use of the object-oriented programming principles we learnt in class.
We assume that the Open-Closed Principle is applied on the `Person` class.
** Cons: Any changes to `Person` may affect `Patient`.
* **Alternative 2:** Create the `Patient` class from the bottom-up.
** Pros: As `Patient` will not be a subclass of any other class, it will be less affected by changes in other classes.
** Cons: All existing classes and methods which currently work with `Person` needs to be re-written to work with the new `Patient` class.
Attributes and methods cannot be reused, and must be re-implemented.
Lastly, polymorphism cannot be applied in cases where there is a need to deal with both persons and patients.

===== Aspect: Picking the appropriate data structure to store dental records

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the records using a list.
** Pros: It is easy to understand, which is crucial for collaborative programming as other programmers may require accessing the records in the list.
It can also save new records in the order of when they are added, from most recent to oldest, simply using `List.add(0, Record)`.
** Cons: If the list gets long over time, it might cause additional waiting time for our users when they would to search for a specific record.
This is because a linear search in a list is of O(n) time complexity.
 * **Alternative 2:** Store the records using a hash table.
 ** Pros: It gives the fastest time complexity if a record search is required. It runs in O(1) time.
 ** Cons: It can be challenging for collaborators to understand, which can be detrimental for collaborative programming.
 It also creates an extra layer of complexity in order to display the stored records in the order they were first stored in the application by our users.

===== Aspect: How the goto command executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a static variable to store the specified patient, with a public getter method, and a static boolean that denotes the current list viewing mode.
** Pros: This is relatively easy to implement and understand. Furthermore, other classes can easily access the current specified patient, and the current list viewing mode.
** Cons: May cause complications if MainWindow is no longer a singleton class.
* **Alternative 2:** Save the specified patient and list viewing mode as an instance variable of MainWindow.
** Pros: Will work properly even if MainWindow is no longer a singleton class.
** Cons: Challenging to implement as major revamp is required to most existing classes and tests.
All new classes which wish to access the specified patient or list viewing mode will need to take in a reference to the MainWindow instance.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the goto command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a patient variable to store the patient specified by the command.
** Pros: An intuitive solution, as the specified patient is stored as an exact same class as a patient.
Additionally, attributes of the specified patient can be accessed just like any other patient class.
Changes to the patient class does not significantly affect the goto command.
** Cons: The patient class is mutable, and accidental changes to its attributes by other classes or methods can occur.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new immutable patient variable to store the specified patient.
** Pros: Ensures the the specified patient cannot be edited by other classes or methods.
** Cons: Major changes to the patient class would require the immutable patient class to be changed too.
Furthermore, every time any record of the specified patient is modified, a new immutable patient needs to be created to update the currently stored immutable patient.

===== Aspect: Data structure for Teeth

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a `Tooth` object representing a tooth, and use an array to store a list of tooth which will represent the teeth of patients.
** Pros: An straightforward object-oriented solution and easy to understand by other collaborating programmers who are familiar with object-oriented programming.
** Cons: `Tooth` and `Teeth` objects, as well as their relevant methods takes a significant amount of time to be created. They will also require proper test cases to be implemented.
* **Alternative 2:** Create an integer array representing teeth. Each integer value in the array indicates the status of a tooth.
** Pros: Simplest to implement.
** Cons: Can be hard to understand by other programmers as integers are used to represent teeth statuses. Additionally, this is violating object-oriented principles.

===== Aspect: Implementing the Dentist class

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a patient variable to store the patient specified by the command.
** Pros: An intuitive solution, as the specified patient is stored as an exact same class as a patient.
Additionally, attributes of the specified patient can be accessed just like any other patient class.
Changes to the patient class does not significantly affect the goto command.
** Cons: The patient class is mutable, and accidental changes to its attributes by other classes or methods can occur.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new immutable patient variable to store the specified patient.
** Pros: Ensures the the specified patient cannot be edited by other classes or methods.
** Cons: Major changes to the patient class would require the immutable patient class to be changed too.
Furthermore, every time any record of the specified patient is modified, a new immutable patient needs to be created to update the currently stored immutable patient.

// end::patient_kyler[]

// tag::task_cchj1995[]
=== Task Management and related commands
0ur user can also utilize TeethHub to store manage and interact with tasks aside from patients. Dentists would often have tasks that needs to be completed or performed and the implementation of the `Task` data object allows TeethHub to provide its user with the ability to manage these tasks and have them interact with their patient's details when necessary as well. The main commands added with the data object serve to provide the user with a way to manage and view the tasks stored in the application.

This segment will explain the main features of the a new data type `Task` that TeethHub handle. Key implementation details and the design considerations when designing these features will also be covered.

==== Task storage and attributes

The `Task` class is a new type of object that is meant to represent any task a dentist would have to perform. `Task` objects are kept in a list and handled by the `UniqueTaskList` class. This follows the same process as the `Patient` class and by extension, the `Person` class which has a `UniquePersonList` handling a list of `Person` objects. 

Storing information of all objects does not change between `Task` and `Person` classes and both are stored into a `TeethHub.json` file. Attributes for `Task` are instantiated as objects with their own methods to validate the user's input much like the current implementation of `Patient`/`Person` .


[NOTE]
Task has an attribute called `LinkedPatient` which stores the `NAME` and `NRIC` of a patient. This is to allow tasks to be bound to a patient and facilliate another implementation `taskdone` .


The following class diagram details the relevant attributes for a `Task` object along with the multiplicity association between the classes:

image::TaskClassDiagramFinal.png[width=""]

==== Task interaction feature (Basic)

Essential commands for basic interaction with the tasks such as, `taskadd`, `taskedit` and `taskdelete` are implemented in a similar fashion as compared to existing commands. All three commands extend from the abstract class `Command` and follow the same execution flow as `patientadd`, `patientedit` and `patientdelete`. 

The generic execution flow of these commands mostly involve the `Logic` and `Model` component of the application and the order can be detailed as follows:

. User's input command gets sent to LogicManager.
. LogicManager sends to AddressBookParser to check command validity.
. AddressBookParser creates a CommandParser(typically named `commandclassnameParser` like `TaskAddCommandParser`) to check the arguments.
. CommandParser creates an instance of the Command and sends it back to LogicManager.
. LogicManager calls the method to execute the Command.
. Command executes and calls methods from Model to interact with the `Task` objects.
. Result from the command's execution gets sent back to the UI and eventually the user.


[NOTE]
Adding and editing tasks may involved additional calls to `Model` if the user specifies a patient to link to the task as the application will have to extract unique information from the `Patient` to store in the task


The following sequence diagram illustrates the stated generic command execution flow and the components involved:

image::GenericSequenceDiagram.png[width=""]

==== Task Autocomplete feature

The `taskdone` command is a feature implemented to allow the user to automatically complete a task of his/her choice, setting it to `COMPLETED`. The command also allows the user to automatically add a record to the task's `LinkedPatient` upon completion of the task. This feature makes use of the `Model` by calling its methods `setTask()` and `setPerson()` to perform additional interactions with both task and patient respectively.

[NOTE]
The current `patientedit` and `patientdelete` commands have been modified to update tasks linked to a patient when said patient gets modified or deleted. However, to keep in line with the concept of Defensive Programming, the execution still check and inform the user in an event where the `LinkedPatient` cannot be found.

The following sequence diagram illustrates flow in which the command's execution takes when completing a task with the index `1`:

image::TaskDoneSequenceDiagram.png[width=""]

==== Task Calendar feature

The `taskcal` command is a feature implemented to allow the user to view task related data in a more interactive and helpful manner. Executing the command creates a popup window with the list of tasks on the left side and a calendar on the rigth side. The popup window will also have a commandbox where the user is able to key in task related commands, dates in the format of `dd-mm-yyyy` to navigate the calendar or exit and help as miscelleanous commands.This feature also enables the user to find tasks depending on the `date` they provide in the commandbox or the date cell they click on such that the task list will update to show users the tasks with start dates and/or end dates on the selected date cell.

The calendar is generated with modifications to the date cells being done during the generation process. Modifications to the date cells (e.g. changing font colors, overlaying a circle) are done to highlight date cells with the color of task priority. The class `CalendarWindow` uses a `HashMap` with the date, as the key and priority number, as a value,to store the start date and end date information from tasks stored in TeethHub, replacing the stored value with a highest priority value between the duplicates. This enables the date cells to be compared with the stored values amidst the generation process, choosing which date cells to highlight with the highest priority color. 

The UI components of this feature are implemented using classes from `JavaFX` with the most important component being `DatePicker` which allows a calendar to be drawn up and displayed to the user. The implementation overrides the `updateItem()` method from `DatePicker` to enable modifications to be done to the date cells in the calendar.


The following swimlane activity diagram illustrates the process in which the application goes through to create and display the interactive calendar for the user:

image::TaskCalendarSwimLaneDiagram.png[width=""]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Storing the task class

* **Current implementation:** Tasks are stored in the same json file as patients.
** **Alternative:** Store the tasks in a seperate json file
*** Alternative Pros: Very unlikely to have a very large json file by saving different data types to a different file.The single json file that stores the data will not become too large if there are too many patients and/or tasks. Reduces the likelihood that the size of the json file will exceed the limit of certain file systems like FAT-32 with a limit of 4GB, which would result in the application being unable to save to the file.
*** Alternative Cons: Increases time spent opening a seperate json file. This results in more I/O work for application, decreasing application load time.Complicated to implement and affects future storage and I/O features. Implementation would affect I/O features that may need to read from the files to export both patients and tasks. Sets a precedent where new data types added in the future should be stored seperately for consistency, which would affect `export` and `import` commands as they have to be changed to read a new file to export/import.
** **Choice Justification**: Most operating systems these days utilize a filesystem that allows for filesizes far beyond 4GB. The limit can go up to 2^64 bytes in NTFS for example and in almost all cases, it is unlikely for the a dentist to have such a large number of patients and tasks. Compared to the cons of the alternative where performance and increased likelihood of issues in the futre, the pros that the alternative offers do not seem valid enough to justify using it over the current choice.


===== Aspect: Representing the Priority class attribute for Task

* **Current implementation:** Java's special Enumeration (Enum) class is used for the Priority class
** **Alternative:** Use a normal class type, with string as inner attribute for Priority.
*** Alternative Pros: Priorities can be named anything the user desires such as "code red", "code blue" for example. Easy to implement as it functions similarly to how `name` and `title` works.
*** Alternative Cons: Priority tracking depends on the user's own memory of what he/she named them and sees as a higher priority, making it difficult for the program to display the appropriate color for priorities to benefit users. Goes against good programming practice which is to use enum for values that should not be changed and Enum is typically used to store priority types.
** **Choice Justification**: Priorities being represented as "high", "med" and "low" is a common case and as such, most if not all people should be able to understand the naming convention. While giving freedom to the user is typically beneficial, in this case, it prevents the application from providing better more value to the user. The current choice uses terms that are understandable whilst providing benefits to the user by enabling a consistent colored display of priority tags.

==== Aspect: Modifying task and patient when executing `taskdone` command

* **Current implementation:** Target task and patient are replaced with new instances with priority changed and record added respectively.
** **Alternative:** Modify the target task and linked patient directly.
*** Alternative Pros: Easy to implement as they already have methods to perform the operations Requires less operations to execute the command, leading to performance increase.
*** Alternative Cons: Completing a task does not work with undo and redo due to the way the model is implemented.
** **Choice Justification**: The current choice enables undo and redo to work with the task autocomplete feature, enabling tasks to be un-completed by using the undo command. This is important as the user could potentially key the wrong index when completing a task and wish to undo the command without having to manually edit the task. From tests done with the alternative, the performance increase is also  negligible at best. The lack of a strong benefit does not make up for the inability to undo/redo making the alternative less desirable as compared to the current choice.

==== Aspect: Data strcuture to support Task Calendar generation

* **Current implementation:** HashMap is used to store dates that have task's starting and/or ending.
** **Alternative:**  Use an ArrayList to store the dates instead.
*** Alternative Pros: Does not require its stored values to have an `equals()` method. Lower memory consuption as there is no need to store both a key and a value. Retrieves elements with `get()` in O(1) time with a specified index.
*** Alternative Cons: Checking if an element exists within is O(n) time as the entire arraylist needs to be checked. Requires knowing the actual index in order to utilize the benefit of an O(1) retrieval.
** **Choice Justification**: The generation of the calendar page requires a data structure that can check if a particular date is contained within itself in order to decide whether a date cell should be highlighted or not. Arraylist would be slower in this case as it would have to peform an O(n) every time a task gets iterated compared to the O(1) a HashMap offers. There is also no need to implement an `equals()` method for the DateCustom object to be stored as it is already implemented to ensure that there are no duplicate tasks. In this case, the current choices is a much better fit as compared to arraylist to support the calendar feature.

==== Aspect: Method of displaying Task Calendar

* **Current implementation:** Task Calendar window is displayed in a seperate popup.
** **Alternative:** Display the calendar in another pane in the Main Window.
*** Alternative Pros: Everything can be shown at one glance to the user. No need to shuffle between windows. No need for a command to make the calendar show.
*** Alternative Cons: Other elements displayed in the Main Window have to be shrunk along with the calendar's contents to make space for the task calendar to be viewed. Main Window would be displaying too many things.
** **Choice Justification**: Shrinking all elements in the Main Window would adversely affect the visibility of other important features the application provdies such as the patient's information, the list of patients and list of tasks. This reduces the user experience as content cannot be clearly seen. Following the traditional usage of a calendar, most people typically look at a calendar when the need arises such as planning or scheduling. It would be better for a command to be provided and show the user a clear and distinct calendar only when he/she requires it, making the current choice ideal.

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{Explain here how the data encryption feature will be implemented}_

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::findimplement[]
=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation

The Find mechanism is facilitated through the use of predicates in conjunction with the
`FilteredList` within `ModelManager`

image::FindCommandSequenceDiagram1.png[width="800"]

The above sequence diagram gives an overview of how a `Find` Command is created. When the proper string arguments for
 a Find Command is entered into the user interface, the arguments are passed to the Logic Manager and then the
 AddressBook parser to determine if the input is valid. If it valid, a new `FindCommandParser` object is then created
  and handles the remaining user input.

From FindCommandParser, it creates a `MultipleContainsKeywordsPredicate` before going into a loop that creates the
respective parameter `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` if the parameter is present within the user input. The newly created
 `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` objects are passed back to the `FindCommandParser` and stored within a list. Once the
 loop has finished the list is passed over to the `MultipleContainKeywordsPredicate` object before it is used in the
 creation of a `FindCommand` object. On success, the `FindCommand` object is returned to the LogicManager as per the
 flow in the sequence diagram.

Whereas the sequence diagram below
gives an overview of it's execution behavior.

_{Placeholder for second execution sequence diagram}_

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Creation of Predicates

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Every associated parameter that is found within either a `Patient` or `Record`
class has an associated `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` that handles the predicate testing when that parameter is
specified to be searched.
* **Alternative 2:** `Patient` and `Record` would each have an individual associated `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` that
 acts as a "class of classes" that contains each respective paramater predicate class within itself.

// end::findimplement[]

=== File Management
Although TeethHub already has a built-in auto-load and auto-save, implementing file management would give the user more flexibility with managing data. +
PDF export is also implemented so that the user would have an easier time making sense of the data when offline.

The File Management features are: `Open`, `Import`, `Save`, `Export`.
* If the file that is being opened/imported is corrupted, an error message is thrown and no change is made. +
* If the user inputs an index range for import/export that does not exist, the current indexes that fall within the range are still imported/exported. This is because we want to make things easier on the user.

[NOTE]
============================================================
These following two keywords will be used by various File Management features.

`FILE_PATH`: The name and file type to be saved. `FILE_PATH` also allows the inclusion of folder names. If the indicated `FILE_PATH` does not exist, it will be created. +
Any letters in the English alphabet and numbers are allowed. +
Allowed special characters are: +
`! @ # $ % ^ & ( ) _ + - = { } [ ] ; ' , .` +
Special characters *NOT* allowed are: +
`< > : " | ? *`

`INDEX_RANGE`: +
Any positive integers (no decimals, must be greater than 0) are allowed. +
Use commas (no space) to indicate a break. e.g. `1,3,5` for 1 and 3 and 5 +
Use dash (no space) to indicate a range. e.g. `3-5` for 3 to 5. `1-3-5` is not allowed, just use `1-5`. +
Use a combination of commas and dashes to indicate a range as well. e.g. `1-3,5` for 1 to 3 and 5. +
`all` can be used instead to include everything. e.g. `import test.json all` or `export test.json all`
============================================================

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Reading or writing a file
* **Current implementation:** (Open/Import/Save/Export)Command -> InOutAddressBookStorage -> JsonUtil -> FileUtil
** **Alternative 1a.1:** (Open/Import/Save/Export)Command -> Json Util -> FileUtil
** **Alternative 1a.2:** (Open/Import/Save/Export)Command -> FileUtil
*** Pros: Less overhead and faster runtime as there are less classes to go through.
*** Cons: InOutAddressBookStorage does some error handling. Bypassing InOutAddressBookStorage would require the same error handling in OpenCommand. Since OpenCommand is not called when the program starts, we cannot move the error handling from InOutAddressBookStorage to OpenCommand. In that case, we would have to copy the error handling instead, which means that we now have a duplicate logic, which is also not ideal.


* **Current implementation:** (Save/Export)Command -> InOutAddressBookStorage -> PdfUtil
** **Alternative 1b.1:** (Save/Export)Command -> Pdf Util -> FileUtil
** **Alternative 1b.2:** (Save/Export)Command -> FileUtil
** **Alternative 1b.3:** (Save/Export)Command -> PdfUtil
*** Pros: Less overhead and faster runtime as there are less classes to go through.
*** Cons: Same as *Alternative 1a* Cons above. In addition to that, passing the job to FileUtil would require implementing Pdf creation and saving that is already present in the third party library Apache PDFBox. Hence the job is passed to PdfUtil which calls the already present methods of Apache PDFBox.

===== Aspect: Index ranges of Import and Export
* **Current implementation:** The Import/Export features accept index ranges that are larger than the actual index range of the content to be imported/exported.
** **Alternative 2:** Don't allow indexes out of range for Import/Export.
*** Pros: User cannot input a very large index range. This prevents a scenario where a very large range causes slow runtime and increased memory due to the amount of indexes to process.
*** Cons: User may feel frustration of being denied due to minor mistakes. e.g. `export data.json 1-31` being rejected when there are only 30 entries. As our goal when designing TeethHub was to make things easier for the user, we decided to go with our current implementation.


* **Current implementation:** The Import/Export features accept the `all` keyword in place of an index range.
** **Alternative 3:** Don't parse "all" keyword for Import/Export.
*** Pros: Faster runtime as there are less characters in the regex to match.
*** Cons: User would need to know the total amount of patients in the external file if importing. Otherwise, the user might resort to inputting a very large index range, which would slow down runtime and increase memory needed due to the amount of indexes to process. We chose the current implementation to provide an alternative so that it would discourage users from inputting a very large index range.


* **Current implementation:** The Export feature calls the Save feature when the `all` keyword is detected.
** **Alternative 4:** Don't parse `all` keyword for Export.
*** Pros: Less overhead and faster runtime as there the regex would not need to look for `all`
*** Cons: In the current implementation, Import and Export share the same parser as Import and Export share the same format of `command FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`. Since Import uses the `all` keyword, not parsing `all` would require an additional parser for Export. Furthermore, as the accepted inputs of Open and Save are the same (except for .pdf), the user may expect the same accepted inputs for Import and Export as well.

==== Open vs Import

Suppose you have a `data.json` file with the following contents:

image::OpenImportFeature1.png[width="174"]

The following image illustrates the difference when you open or import `data.json`.

image::OpenImportFeature2.png[width="870"]

==== Open feature
===== Current Implementation
As TeethHub already has a built-in auto-load when starting the program, the implemented Open feature is simple. +
*The Open feature opens the specified file and overwrites the current TeethHub data with the file data.* +
The Open feature's format is: `open FILE_PATH`

1. AddressBookParser creates OpenCommandParser. +
2. The OpenCommandParser uses ParserUtil to parse the user input. +
3. If the input is valid, ParserUtil creates a ParsedInOut object and returns it to OpenCommandParser. +
4. OpenCommandParser creates OpenCommand initialized with the ParsedInOut object. +
5. OpenCommand checks for if the requested file is a ".json" file, if the file exists, if it is a file, or if it can be read. +
6. OpenCommand calls the existing readAddressBook().

image::OpenCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg[width="870"]

==== Import feature
===== Current Implementation
As TeethHub already has a built-in auto-load when starting the program, the implemented Import feature makes use of it. +
*The Import feature opens the specified file and adds the file data to the current TeethHub data.* +
The Import feature's format is: `import FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

1. AddressBookParser creates ImportCommandParser. +
2. The ImportCommandParser uses ParserUtil to parse the user input. +
3. If the input is valid, ParserUtil creates a ParsedInOut object and returns it to ImportCommandParser. +
4. ImportCommandParser creates ImportCommand initialized with the ParsedInOut object. +
5. ImportCommand checks for if the requested file is a ".json" file, if the file exists, if it is a file, or if it can be read. +
6. ImportCommand calls the existing readAddressBook() on a temporary storage. +
6a. ImportCommand adds contents from the temporary storage to the current storage based on the input INDEX_RANGE. +
6b. ImportCommand adds all contents from the temporary storage to the current storage if INDEX_RANGE is `all`.

==== Save feature
===== Current Implementation
As TeethHub already has a built-in auto-save when exiting the program, the implemented Save feature makes use of it. +
*The Save feature saves all current TeethHub data to the specified file.* +
In addition to that, the Save can also save to PDF, using the Apache PDFBox. +
In the Open Command Sequence Diagram above, you can see that OpenCommand creates an InOutAddressBookStorage. The InOutAddressBookStorage has the capability to call the existing saveAddressBook() and also a new saveAsPdf(). +
The Save feature's format is: `save FILE_PATH`

1. AddressBookParser creates SaveCommandParser. +
2. The SaveCommandParser uses ParserUtil to parse the user input. +
3. If the input is valid, ParserUtil creates a ParsedInOut object and returns it to SaveCommandParser. +
4. SaveCommandParser creates SaveCommand initialized with the ParsedInOut object. +
5. SaveCommand checks for if the requested file is a ".json" file or ".pdf" file. It also checks if the file is Read-only. +
5a. SaveCommand calls the existing saveAddressBook() if the requested file is a ".json" file. +
5b. SaveCommand calls the new saveAsPdf() if the requested file is a ".pdf" file.

==== Export feature
===== Current Implementation
As TeethHub already has a built-in auto-save when starting the program, the implemented Export feature makes use of it. +
*The Export feature saves specified patients in the current TeethHub data to the specified file.* +
The Export feature's format is: `export FILE_PATH INDEX_RANGE`

image::ExportCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="870"]

1. AddressBookParser creates ExportCommandParser. +
2. The ExportCommandParser uses ParserUtil to parse the user input. +
3. If the input is valid, ParserUtil creates a ParsedInOut object and returns it to ExportCommandParser. +
4. ExportCommandParser creates ImportCommand initialized with the ParsedInOut object. +
5. ExportCommand checks if INDEX_RANGE is `all`. +
5a. ExportCommand calls SaveCommand if INDEX_RANGE is `all`. Refer to Save feature. +
5b. Otherwise, ExportCommand add contents from the current storage to the temporary storage based on the input INDEX_RANGE. +
6. ExportCommand checks for if the requested file is a ".json" file or ".pdf" file. It also checks if the file is Read-only. +
6a. ExportCommand calls the existing saveAddressBook() if the requested file is a ".json" file. +
6b. ExportCommand calls the new saveAsPdf() if the requested file is a ".pdf" file.

=== Suggestion feature
==== Current Implementation
As TeethHub contains commands that are similar, we decided to implement a Suggestion feature. +
This feature was designed to help users who are familiar with older versions of TeethHub or Address Book 4, as they have the names of old commands. +
When the user types a Common command, a suggestion will be displayed asking the user if they meant to type something else. +
We define a Common command as a command whose name is used by the Patient commands, Record commands and/or Task commands. +
For example, as there are `patientadd`, `recordadd` and `taskadd`, the Common command would be `add`. +
As TeethHub has a Patient Mode and a Record Mode, only commands that can be used in the user's current mode will be displayed.

image::SuggestionFeatureAddPatientMode.png[width="236"]

==== Design Considerations
* **Current implementation:** When the user types a Common command, suggestions are displayed. +
** **Alternative 1:** Show Help window if the user inputs invalid commands `N` times in a row.
*** Pros: Only 1 implementation, as opposed to an implementation for each Common command. +
*** Cons: Might be rude.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repository (this bloats the repository size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all persons in the list.

** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/PatientFindCommand.java[`PatientFindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/PatientDeleteCommand.java[`PatientDeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `PatientFindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.

==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in the address book, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the address book.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`] allows you to update a person, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/AddressBook.java[`AddressBook`]. Loop through each person, and remove the `tag` from each person.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `AddressBook#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.

==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how the users use your address book application. You realize that one of the users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last person in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside person cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the address book to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the address book after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the address book storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook)`, so that the address book can be saved in a fixed temporary location.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a person specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first person to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first person.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParser.java[`AddressBookParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/AddressBookParserTest.java[`AddressBookParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each person later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Person` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the person will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/TeethHub.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Person` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonAddressBook.json`, `typicalPersonsAddressBook.json`, `validAddressBook.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Person` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java[`Person`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the person that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Person` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Person` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a person.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
